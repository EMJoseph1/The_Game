# The_Game

This was one of my first projects using HTML, CSS and Javascript with some manipulation of the DOM. My idea was to make a turn based fighting game, similar to final fantasy.
Two of the struggles I was having was how to automate the computer to do a move after I did my move and I nearly made this game a two player game for the sake of simplicity.
Another struggle I was having was I was constantly getting undefines and my buttons were not working with took a lot of troubleshooting and I must thank my instructors and classmates for
helping me solves these major issues I was having.
Also some minor issues I had was I wanted to add some type of animation so one would not get bored staring at the same screen the entire time. Also a general issue I was having was how
to exactly start considering this was one of my first projects built from scratch with not much of template to go on.
How I ended up starting was first making my buttons in HTML and my functions in javascript. Then I talked through how I wanted each function to work. A small problem I ran into of course
was how to put it all together while also making sure the syntax was correct.
To conclude, this was very tough project for me because I had much trouble starting and when I got stuck, it took me awhile to get unstuck. There are also many things I wanted to add such as
a block button to nullify an enemies attack, more animation to make the battle have some life to it, a way to lose charges, penatlies for spamming certain moves like healing or charging as
well as a few minor optimizations and a one small bug I simply could not fix.
I definitely want to add to this game in the future.
